# Introduction To Information Security And Cybersecurity
## Information Security vs Cybersecurity
| **Aspect**                 | **Information Security (InfoSec)**                                                                                       | **Cybersecurity**                                            
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Protection of **all forms of information** (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. | Protection of **digital assets, systems, network, and data** from cyberattacks originating through the internet or other digital means.|
| **Scope**                  | Broader – includes **data in any form** (printed, spoken, written, electronic).                                          | Narrower – focuses **only on digital and network-based threats**.|
| **Objective**              | Ensure **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of information, regardless of meaning.                     | Protect **computers, servers, networks, apps, and data** from online attacks,breaches and malware|
| **Primary Focus**          | Data protection (physical + digital).                                                                                    | System & network defense (digital only).                    |
| **Examples of Protection** | Physical documents, spoken info, digital data.                                                                           | Firewalls, encryption, antivirus, secure networks.          |
