# Encyrption Technique
## Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics.
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts.
## Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communication, integrity and authentication.
 ## symmetric Encryption 
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.
## Asymmetric Encryption 
- Uses two keys: Public key (for encryption) & private key (for decryption).
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.
## hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- one-way process - cannot be reversed.
- Used for password storage and integrity checking.
- Common algorithm: SHA-256, MDS (deprecated)
