# Security Principles 
## Learing Objective
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate security principles to real-world cyber incidents.

# CIA Triad
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- Each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy.

| Element            | Description                                                        | Example                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality | Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.               | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists.  |
| Integrity       | Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with.       | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums.            |
| Availability    | Ensures systems and data are available when needed.                | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection.             |

# Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key — too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).

# Examples
- Confidentiality Violation: Unauthorized access to customer data (e.g., Facebook–Cambridge Analytica case).
- Integrity Violation: Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis.
- Availability Violation: DDoS attack on banking websites preventing service access.
- # Risk, Privacy and Accountability
## Risk
- Definition- Probability of a threat exploitingh a vulnerability to cause harm.

## Components:
- Threat - something that can cause damage.
- Vulnerability - weakmess that can be exploited.
- Impact - damage if threat is realized.

# Formulas 
Risk = threat x vulnerablitiy x impact

## Examples
- Threat:phising

## Privacy
- Protecting personel and sensitive information of individuals.
- Governed by laws like GDPR, DPDP Act(India), HIPAA

# Key Practices
- Data minimization
- Informed consent
- Data anonmymization
Example: A Healthcare app must not share user helath data without consent
